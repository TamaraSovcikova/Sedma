## Sedma Explanation

Sedma is a traditional Czech 4-card trick-and-draw game played in fixed partnerships. The game revolves around capturing tricks and scoring points. The most powerful cards are the Sevens, beating all others. Aces and Tens are scoring cards, each worth 10 points. The objective is to accumulate at least 50 points in a deal. Players strategically play cards to maximize their score, and the game continues until a set number of stakes are reached.
